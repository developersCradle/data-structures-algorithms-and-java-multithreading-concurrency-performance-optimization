All course material from *Java Multithreading, Concurrency & Performance Optimization* by **Michael Pogrebinsky** and **Top Developer Academy LLC**.

> We were working with an old legacy system that was making two concurrent calls to a shared resource, causing inconsistent results that only appeared sometimes. The issue was subtle and difficult to reproduce, making it even harder to diagnose. What made it even harder was not runnable on our local environment! 
>
> A recent course I had taken on `Java Multithreading and Concurrency` proved invaluable. It helped me identify the race condition and apply the `synchronized` keyword correctly to control access to the critical section. With proper thread coordination in place, the system stabilized without requiring a major rewrite of the legacy code.<br><br>

All course material from *Multithreading, Parallel & Asynchronous Coding in Modern Java* by **Pragmatic Code School**.

> During a live technical demonstration at **Evitec Solutions**, I was asked to solve a puzzle involving a Java problem that required clean data processing logic. Under normal circumstances, it was a problem perfectly suited for **Java Streams**, but the pressure of the live session caused me to overlook that approach.
>
>That moment became a turning point. It pushed me to deeply pursue a course on `Modern Java`, where I strengthened my understanding of streams, functional patterns, and expressive problem-solving techniques. The experience helped me regain confidence and sharpen my ability to apply the right abstractions even in high-pressure situations.<br><br>

All course material from *Java Application Performance Tuning and Memory Management* by from **Matt Greencroft** ... Sir **Matt Greencroft** and **Virtual Pair Programmers** with my own visual notes. ✍️

> I interviewed with **Polar** for an Advanced Java role, and the technical discussion immediately dove into multithreading, concurrency, and performance optimization. They asked about thread pools, synchronization strategies, deadlocks, optimizing CPU-bound versus IO-bound operations, and even Virtual Threads in Java. The questions were challenging and required more than just textbook knowledge — they wanted practical understanding of real-world thread behavior.
>
>Thanks to a recent course on `Java Multithreading, Concurrency & Performance Optimization`, I could confidently discuss thread-safe collections, locks, executor frameworks, and the advantages of Virtual Threads for scalable, lightweight concurrency. Even though I was **not chosen** for the position, the interview **drove me** to deeply pursue these concepts, strengthening my skills and confidence for future challenges.<br><br>

All course material from *Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java* by **Goran Lochert**, **Tim Buchalka** and **Tim Buchalka's Learn Programming Academy**.

>I once interviewed with **Vaisala** for the *Observation Network Manager NM10* role, where the technical discussion went deep into data structures and their operations. The interview challenged my understanding of trees, graphs, and time–space trade-offs in ways I hadn’t fully experienced before. [Project](https://www.vaisala.com/en/products/weather-environmental-sensors/observation-network-manager-nm10).
>
> Although I **wasn’t** selected for the position, the experience became a turning point. It drove me to truly internalize the concepts through a deep dive into `Data Structures and Algorithms using Java`, strengthening both my problem-solving approach and technical confidence for future challenges.
