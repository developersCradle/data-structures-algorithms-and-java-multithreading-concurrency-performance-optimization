All course material from Java Multithreading, Concurrency & Performance Optimization by **Michael Pogrebinsky** and **Top Developer Academy LLC**.

>We were working with an old legacy system that was making two concurrent calls to a shared resource, causing inconsistent results that only appeared sometimes. The issue was subtle and difficult to reproduce, making it even harder to diagnose.
>
>A recent course I had taken on `Java Multithreading and Concurrency` proved invaluable. It helped me identify the race condition and apply the `synchronized` keyword correctly to control access to the critical section. With proper thread coordination in place, the system stabilized without requiring a major rewrite of the legacy code.<br><br>

All course material from Multithreading, Parallel & Asynchronous Coding in Modern Java by **Pragmatic Code School**.

> During a live technical demonstration at **Evitec Solutions**, I was asked to solve a puzzle involving a Java problem that required clean data processing logic. Under normal circumstances, it was a problem perfectly suited for **Java Streams**, but the pressure of the live session caused me to overlook that approach.
>
>That moment became a turning point. It pushed me to deeply pursue a course on `Modern Java`, where I strengthened my understanding of streams, functional patterns, and expressive problem-solving techniques. The experience helped me regain confidence and sharpen my ability to apply the right abstractions even in high-pressure situations.<br><br>

All course material from **Java Application Performance Tuning and Memory Management** by from **Matt Greencroft** and **Virtual Pair Programmers** with my own visual notes. ✍️

>I interviewed with **Polar** for an Advanced Java role, and the technical discussion immediately dove into multithreading, concurrency, and performance optimization. They asked about thread pools, synchronization strategies, deadlocks, optimizing CPU-bound versus IO-bound operations, and even Virtual Threads in Java. The questions were challenging and required more than just textbook knowledge — they wanted practical understanding of real-world thread behavior.
>
>Thanks to a recent course on `Java Multithreading, Concurrency & Performance Optimization`, I could confidently discuss thread-safe collections, locks, executor frameworks, and the advantages of **Virtual Threads** for scalable, lightweight concurrency. Even though I was **not chosen** for the position, the interview **drove me** to deeply pursue these concepts, strengthening my skills and confidence for future challenges.<br><br>

All course material from Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java by **Goran Lochert**, **Tim Buchalka** and **Tim Buchalka's Learn Programming Academy**.

>I once interviewed with **Vaisala** for the *Observation Network Manager NM10* role, where the technical discussion went deep into data structures and their operations. The interview challenged my understanding of trees, graphs, and time–space trade-offs in ways I hadn’t fully experienced before. [Project](https://www.vaisala.com/en/products/weather-environmental-sensors/observation-network-manager-nm10).
>
> Although I **wasn’t** selected for the position, the experience became a turning point. It drove me to truly internalize the concepts through a deep dive into `Data Structures and Algorithms using Java`, strengthening both my problem-solving approach and technical confidence for future challenges.
