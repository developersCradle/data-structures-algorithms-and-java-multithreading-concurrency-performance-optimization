All course material from **Data Structures and Algorithms with Visualizations with Java** by from Dinesh Varyani.

This repository is made with **Eclipse**, therefore it will include configuration files which are related to this IDE this approach will be favored for now. ⚙️

If the content sparked :fire: your interest, please consider starting the course and start learning :book:.
