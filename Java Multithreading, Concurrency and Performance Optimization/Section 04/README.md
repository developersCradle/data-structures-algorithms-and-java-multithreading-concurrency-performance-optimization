1. Defining **Performance** criteria.

1. **Metric of performance** in this particular case is the **Latency** in units of time!
    - Faster the transportation is the faster the **performance** is.

1. If the **Application** will provide **1000** frames per second and the **player** plays it as **20** per second `2.`. There are a lot of **waste frames**, this is not valid **metric** for the performance.
3. The right metric would be in this place, **precision** and **accuracy** of the **frame rate**!

1. The **performance metric** here is the **throughput**, better the recommended data, better it at performing!
